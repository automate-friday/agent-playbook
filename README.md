# Agent Playbook

Coaching patterns, process principles, and operational playbook for Automate Friday's agent team.

## What's Here

- **coaching-analysis-2026-02-08.md** — Extracted from Jacob's coaching during the AUT-275 test specs sprint. Covers process principles, anti-patterns, communication preferences, and repeatable workflows.

## Purpose

This repo captures how the team should work — not what to build, but *how* to build it. Patterns learned the hard way get documented here so future agents (and current ones) don't repeat mistakes.
